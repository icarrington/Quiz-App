# Quiz-App
To set up this quiz I created an array of objects that contain the fruit name and image url. Then a random item is chosen from the fruits array and the image is added to the question container along with 4 choices including the correct fruit. When you click on the next button, the correct answer is highlighted and the quiz keeps track of how many correct answers you selected.
